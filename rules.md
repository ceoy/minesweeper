# Instructions for MineSweeper

## Quick Start:

- You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.
- Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.
- To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a bomb, point and right-click (or hover with the mouse and press Space).

## Detailed Instructions:

- A squares "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges.
- If you open a square with 0 neighboring bombs, all its neighbors will automatically open. This can cause a large area to automatically open.
- To remove a bomb marker from a square, point at it and right-click again.
- The first square you open is never a bomb.
- If you mark a bomb incorrectly, you will have to correct the mistake before you can win. Incorrect bomb marking doesn't kill you, but it can lead to mistakes which do.
- You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares.
- Right-clicking twice will give you a question mark symbol which can be useful if you are unsure about a square
- Click the yellow happy face to start a new game.

## Status Information:

- The upper left corner contains the number of bombs left to find. The number will update as you mark and unmark squares.
- The upper right corner contains a time counter. The timer will max out at 999 (16 minutes 39 seconds).
- Click on the time to switch to the number of moves counter. Click again to switch back to the time.
